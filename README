    Testers

VERSION
    version 1.999002

SYNOPSIS
      use CPAN::Testers::Metabase::Demo;

      $mb->public_librarian->search( %search spec );

DESCRIPTION
    The CPAN::Testers::Metabase namespace is intended to span a collection
    of classes that instantiate specific Metabase backend storage and
    indexing capabilities for a CPAN Testers style Metabase.

    Each class consumes the Metabase::Gateway role and can be used by the
    Metabase::Web application as a data model.

    See specific classes for more detail:

    *   [CPAN::Testers::Metabase::AWS] -- storage and indexing with Amazon
        Web Services

    *   [CPAN::Testers::Metabase::MongoDB] -- storage and indexing with
        MongoDB

    *   [CPAN::Testers::Metabase::Demo] -- SQLite archive and flat-file
        index (for test/demo purposes only)
