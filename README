NAME
    CPAN::Testers::Metabase - Instantiate a Metabase backend for CPAN
    Testers

VERSION
    version 1.999001

SYNOPSIS
         use CPAN::Testers::Metabase::AWS;
 
         my $mb = CPAN::Testers::Metabase::AWS->new( %aws_args );

DESCRIPTION
    The CPAN::Testers::Metabase namespace is intended to span a collection
    of subclasses that instantiate specific Metabase backend storage and
    indexing capabilities for a CPAN Testers style Metabase.

    Each subclass consumes the Metabase::Gateway role and can be used by the
    Metabase::Web application as a data model.

    See specific classes for more detail:

    *   CPAN::Testers::Metabase::AWS -- storage and indexing with Amazon Web
        Services

    *   CPAN::Testers::Metabase::Demo -- SQLite archive and flat-file index
        (for test/demo purposes only)
